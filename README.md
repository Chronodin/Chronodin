- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chronodin, I know almost nothing about coding lmao but I want to get better.
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly vidya, also playing guitar.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to tackle the most basic steps in c++ in only 8 hours.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, at the moment. trust me you don't want me touching your code lmao
      I hardly know what my own code does and I wrote it
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can comment here on my repo's and ill reply when I can.  :)

Any and all help and advice is greatly appreciated. I'm still extremely new to this whole coding thing but I know I enjoy a challenge :)
